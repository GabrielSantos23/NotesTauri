## What is Notes V2?

Notes V2 is a local-first desktop notes app built with Tauri and React. It pairs a distraction-free editor with dual sidebars: a notes list on the left and a smart clipboard history on the right. It detects links, code snippets, and screenshots from your clipboard to help you capture, organize, and export knowledge fast.

> All data is stored locally. Exports use your system's native file dialog.

## App layout at a glance

- **Left sidebar (Notes)**: Create, search, select, export, and delete notes. Persists state across sessions.
- **Center (Editor)**: Rich editor powered by TipTap with code blocks, images, drag-and-drop, and Markdown-aware paste.
- **Right sidebar (Clipboard)**: Searchable clipboard history with pinning, drag to editor, restore to clipboard, and bulk clear.

## Key features

- **Local-first**: Data stored on your device via Tauri, with optional persistence of clipboard history.
- **Smart clipboard capture**: Automatically detects text, code, links, and screenshots.
- **Fast capture to note**: Paste or drag clipboard entries directly into the editor.
- **URL intelligence**: Normalizes multiple links, shows favicons/domains, and opens them natively.
- **Code-aware editing**: Heuristics detect code and create highlighted code blocks with language support.
- **Image tooling**: Paste images/screenshots, resize with a handle, and float left/right/none.
- **Autosave + guard rails**: Save with Ctrl/Cmd+S and protection against losing unsaved changes when navigating.
- **Markdown export**: One-click export via native dialog.
- **Tunable rules**: JSON rules to tag/ignore/merge clipboard captures.

## Capture from the clipboard

- **Automatic monitoring**: When enabled, copied text is analyzed and added to history.
  - Detects URLs and normalizes them.
  - Detects likely code snippets using whitespace and token heuristics.
  - Adds domain-based tags for common sites (e.g., GitHub).
- **Screenshots**: On Windows, the app detects screenshot tooling/window titles and offers to insert screenshots right into your note.
- **Privacy-minded**: You can disable monitoring or persistence at any time.

## Writing notes

- **Title + Links**: Add a title and optional multiple links. Links render with favicon + domain and can be opened natively.
- **Editor**: TipTap with:
  - Headings, lists, bold/italic, blockquotes
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting (JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Bash, Python, Go, Rust, YAML, Markdown…)
  - Image paste/drag, resizable with a handle, float left/right/none
  - Drag text/code directly from clipboard history into the editor
- **Smart paste**: Pasting multi-line code or fenced blocks auto-creates a proper code block.

## Managing notes

- **Create**: Click New Note or hit the primary action in the left sidebar.
- **Search**: Filter notes instantly as you type.
- **Select**: Route-based selection persists across reloads; last note is restored.
- **Delete**: Right-click/context menu or the row menu.
- **Export**: Export any note to Markdown via the native file dialog.

## Links UI (multi-URL)

- Paste or add multiple URLs. Notes V2 normalizes and deduplicates.
- Primary link shows with favicon + domain; extra links are accessible via a +N dropdown.
- Click to open in your system browser (using Tauri native open; falls back to window.open).

## Clipboard history (right sidebar)

- **Search**: Filter instantly.
- **Pin/Unpin**: Keep important snippets at the top.
- **Restore**: Copy an entry back to clipboard.
- **Delete**: Remove individual entries or clear all (choose to keep pinned or not).
- **Drag-and-drop**: Drag entries into the editor to insert.

## Autosave and unsaved-change guard

- **Autosave shortcut**: Ctrl/Cmd+S saves.
- **Unsaved changes prompt**: If you try to navigate away with unsaved edits, you’ll be asked to Save, Discard, or Cancel.
- **Minimized save**: If the window is minimized, a native notification confirms a successful save.

## Settings

- **Clipboard monitoring**: Toggle auto-import from clipboard.
- **Persistence**: Toggle saving clipboard history to disk and restoring on launch.
- **Minimum text length**: Skip short copies unless detected as code/link.
- **Deduplication window**: Avoid re-adding near-duplicates for N minutes.
- **Rules (JSON)**: Add regex rules to tag, ignore, or merge captures.

```json
[
  {
    "pattern": "github\\.com",
    "field": "url",
    "action": "tag",
    "tag": "github"
  },
  { "pattern": "password", "field": "text", "action": "ignore" },
  { "pattern": "(api|token)", "field": "text", "action": "merge" }
]
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

- **Save**: Ctrl/Cmd+S
- **Toggle right sidebar**: Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+B

## Privacy and data

- Notes and history stay on your device. No cloud by default.
- Export uses your OS-native file dialog; nothing is uploaded.

## Updating

- Check for updates from Settings. On Windows installer builds, the updater handles restart when needed.

## Tips

- Drag code/text from the clipboard sidebar directly into the editor to keep flow.
- Use multiple links per note; the +N dropdown keeps the UI tidy.
- Use rules to auto-tag content from specific domains or ignore sensitive patterns.
